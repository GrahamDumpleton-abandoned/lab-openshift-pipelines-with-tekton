A pipeline defines a number of tasks that should be executed and how they interact with each other via their inputs and outputs.

In this tutorial, you will create a pipeline that takes the source code of PetClinic application from GitHub and then builds and deploys it on OpenShift using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#build-strategy-s2i_understanding-image-builds[Source-to-Image (S2I)].

Here is the YAML file that represents the above pipeline:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  - name: app-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: s2i-java-8
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        value: "false"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: app-image
  - name: deploy
    taskRef:
      name: openshift-client
    runAfter:
      - build
    params:
    - name: ARGS
      value: "rollout latest spring-petclinic"
----

This pipeline performs the following:

1. Clones the source code of the application from a Git repository (`app-git` resource)
3. Builds the container image using the `s2i-java-8` task that generates a Dockerfile for the application and uses link:https://buildah.io/[Buildah] to build the image
4. The application image is pushed to an image registry (`app-image` resource)
5. The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the `openshift-cli`

You might have noticed that there are no references to the PetClinic Git repository and its image in the registry. That's because `Pipeline`s in Tekton are designed to be generic and re-usable across environments and stages through the application's lifecycle. `Pipeline`s abstract away the specifics of the Git source repository and image to be produced as `resource`s. When triggering a pipeline, you can provide different Git repositories and image registries to be used during pipeline execution. Be patient! You will do that in a little bit in the next section.

The tasks execution order is determined based on the dependencies that are defined between the tasks via `inputs` and `outputs` as well as explicit orders that are defined via `runAfter`.

Save the pipeline definition as a `.yaml` file and then create it using `oc create -f YOUR_FILE_NAME.yaml`. Alternatively, in the OpenShift console, you can click on **Add &#8594; Import YAML** at the top right of the screen while you are in the **pipelines-tutorial** project, paste the YAML into the textfield, and click on **Create**.
